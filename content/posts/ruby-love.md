I've decided to start this blog to share my experiences and thoughts about software development, particularly focusing on Ruby, Rails, and building scalable systems.

In this blog, you'll find:
- Technical deep-dives into Ruby and Rails
- System design discussions
- Tips and tricks I've learned at Moyasar
- My thoughts on developer productivity

Stay tuned for more posts!
